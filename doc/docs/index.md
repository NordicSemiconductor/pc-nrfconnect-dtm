# {{app_name}}

The {{app_name}} in nRF Connect for Desktop provides a graphical UI for the Direct Test Mode (DTM) commands through 2-wire UART. The DTM is a BluetoothÂ® test framework used for performing RF PHY testing of Bluetooth Low Energy devices and ensuring interoperability of the Bluetooth devices.

You can use the {{app_name}} to control the following features of the radio:

- Set transmission power and receiver sensitivity
- Set frequency offset and drift
- Set modulation characteristics
- Verify packet error rate
- Set intermodulation performance

See the [Bluetooth Core specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification-5-3/) (volume 6, part F) for more information about the DTM requirements.

!!! tip "Important"
      The {{app_name}} cannot be used as a testing or certification tool. This is because it only provides a graphical wrapper around DTM commands for the Upper Tester. For verification using both the Upper Tester and the Lower Tester, you need an external tester equipment. For example, in case of the [Direct Test Mode Bluetooth sample](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/samples/bluetooth/direct_test_mode/README.html), this can be the Anritsu MT8852 or similar, in which case you obtain the following configuration:

The {{app_name}} is installed and updated using [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/index.html) (v4.4.1 or later).

## Supported devices

The {{app_name}} can be used with devices programmed with firmware compatible with Direct Test Mode:

* The {{app_name}} provides HEX files with firmware compatible with Direct Test Mode for the following devices:

    - nRF52840 DK (PCA10056)
    - nRF52 DK (nRF52832 DK; PCA10040)

    When using these devices, the {{app_name}} will automatically detect when started if the connected device has the right firmware programmed and will offer to program it.

* You can use other devices from Nordic Semiconductor, as long as they are programmed with firmware compatible with Direct Test Mode.<br/>
  For example, you can use one of the devices compatible with the [Direct Test Mode Bluetooth sample](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/samples/bluetooth/direct_test_mode/README.html) from the nRF Connect SDK and programmed with this sample. For such devices, the {{app_name}} does not provide the required firmware, which might result in an error ("DTM setup reset command failed") if you do not program them beforehand when [using the app](using_dtm.md).

    !!! note "Note"
         The [Direct Test Mode Bluetooth sample](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/samples/bluetooth/direct_test_mode/README.html) supports two Device Under Test communication protocols: 2-wire UART and experimental HCI UART interface. The {{app_name}} only supports the 2-wire UART.

* You can also use third-party devices that are programmed with the DTM standard protocol and expose access to it through a serial port.

## Application source code

The code of the application is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-dtm).
